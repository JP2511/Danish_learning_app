# Danish_learning_app
<p>This is an app to help me learn danish.</p>
<p>It is just a simple app that randomly selects a word (danish or english) and 4 possible translations (english or danish, respectively). If the first word is danish, it will play the pronounciation of the word when it first appears and each time you select an option (incorrect or correct). If, however, the word is in english, it only plays the pronounciation of the word when you guess the correct answer.</p>
<p>The mp3 sound files of the pronounciation of each word were obtained through an asynchronous web scrapping script (obtain_word_pronounciation) that will soon be incorporated into the app. The mp3 files were obtained from https://ordnet.dk/ddo.</p>
<p>The app only works in android and it is not planned to change that.</p>
<p>The app file is availabe in the bin/ directory. It has the name danishlearn-0.1-armeabi-v7a-debug.apk </p>
